# vibrant-php
Pick the particular color from an image which contains your desired lightness and saturation. It is something like the awesome palette class in Android  (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/graphics/Palette.html) or vibrant.js (https://jariz.github.io/vibrant.js/) but instead it returns only one color based on your own demand.

# Dependency:
This PHP function is dependent on @brendonheyer's (https://gist.github.com/brandonheyer) rgbToHsl.php (https://gist.github.com/brandonheyer/5254516) and it must be included before vibrant.php. Thanks to him for it saved a lot of time.
